📘 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

MIS 451 – Machine Learning for Busines

📌 Overview

This project builds predictive Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to determine whether a hotel booking will be canceled or completed. With a cancellation rate of nearly 37%, hotels experience significant revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. By developing a robust prediction system, hotels can optimize inventory, reduce overbooking risks, and improve revenue management.

This repository contains the full pipeline, from data preprocessing and EDA to machine learning models, deep learning models, and business recommendations.

🎯 Project Objectives

Predict hotel booking cancellations using ML and DL models.

Help hotels implement:

- Smarter overbooking strategies
- Targeted retention incentives
- Better resource planning
- Reduce lost revenue caused by unexpected cancellations.

🧠 Business Context

The hospitality industry faces:

- Volatile cancellation rates
- Overbooking risks
- Revenue leakage from unused inventory
- Misalignment between forecasted and actual check-ins
  
Stakeholders affected:

- Hotel Management – occupancy, ADR
- Revenue Managers – pricing, yield management
- Operations/Front Desk – staffing, room assignment
- This project provides data-driven insight to strengthen decision-making.
